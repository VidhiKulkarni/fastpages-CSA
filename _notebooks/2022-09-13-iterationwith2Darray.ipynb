    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is this program in more of an Imperative Programming Style or OOP style? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is more of an Imperative Programming Style because we are just printing a 2-dimensional array. There are no objects or values being assigned in the program. There are also no classes in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Observe variable assignments.\n",
    "The variables are assigned within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is each Monkey an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each monkey is not an object because we are not defining objects in a class. We are printing a 2-dimensional array, so each monkey is a different row in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Build an where the monkey is an object versus two-dimensional array. This would be leading into Unit 5 requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "My code is shown above. I used a one dimensional array to print the ants horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Study loops and zero based counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero based counting is a way of numbering in which the initial element of a sequence is assigned the index 0, rather than the index 1 as is typical in everyday non-mathematical or non-programming circumstances. In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Study two-dimensional (2D) array references\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell of the array is a variable that can hold a value and works like any variable. As with one dimensional arrays, every cell in a 2D array is of the same type. The type can be a primitive type or an object reference type.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Explain different way you can access a 2D array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, when accessing the element from a 2D array using arr[first][second] , the first index can be thought of as the desired row, and the second index is used for the desired column. Just like 1D arrays, 2D arrays are indexed starting at 0 .\n",
