<p>The two speakers that came to our talk were Kathyleen Beveridge (project management) and Kris Porter (developer operation). Both speakers had lots of relevant experience in the technology industry, and they shared a lot about their journeys within the field. One thing that Ms. Beveridge pointed out was that all of the technology companies that she has worked at have had the common goal of making something that the world wants or needs. For example, at Thermo Fisher, her company is a biotechnology company that enables customers to make the world cleaner and safer. At HP and Qualcomm, both companies aimed to create technology that people love and can make life better for everyone. I can connect this to PBL because the projects that we are working on also relate to making the world a better place in some aspect. For example, in trimester 1, my team and I built a website that allows users to find safe places to travel to and the crime rates in their area. This technology can make the world a better place and many users can use this site for personal safety. My group also hopes to expand the number of users that use our site so that we can have an even greater impact on the general population. Another thing that stood out to me was how both speakers discussed the positive impact of knowing how to code in a variety of careers. For example, Ms. Beveridge discussed how knowing how to code helps you look at and think about problems differently. It also allows you to understand a methodical way of thinking. Both speakers also discussed the most important skills to have in a technology job. The two skills mentioned were adaptation and always learning. These skills are also used in our AP CSA class because we are always learning new things and we apply this knowledge into building our PBL projects. We also are constantly adapting to new issues and working with one another. Lastly, there are many skills that we are learning in class that apply to the real world in technology. For example, many skills/tools were referred through throughout the talk such as RapidAPI, DevOps, AWS, Gitlab, etc. Overall, I learned a lot about the technology industry through this panel and made many connections to the skills that we are learning in class.</p>
